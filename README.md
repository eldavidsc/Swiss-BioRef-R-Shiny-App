# Masterthesis of David Schaer

In order to use the BioRef Shiny App you may copy your dataset as a .csv file into this folder.
By sourcing the file CreateLabtestSubsets.R your dataset will be read in and create several .rds subset files, one for each of the Labtestes Aspartate, Creatinine, Hemoglobin, Cholesterol, Potassium and Leukocytes. This may take a few hours. 
After the calculations are done your original dataset is not needed anymore and you may use the R shiny app.
